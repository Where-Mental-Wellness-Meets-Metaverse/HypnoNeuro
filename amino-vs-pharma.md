## ðŸŒ¿ Amino Acids vs Pharmaceuticals â€“ A Naturopathic Comparison

This chart summarizes neurotransmitter support strategies and compares common pharmaceutical approaches based on FAERS & DAWN data (2020â€“2024). The emphasis is on **amino acid therapy as the primary approach**, with pharmaceuticals shown for contrast only.

| **Neurotransmitter System** | **Condition(s)** | **Primary Naturopathic Support** | **Top 3 Pharmaceuticals** | **Why Natural First?** |
|-----------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
