## ðŸŒ¿ Amino Acids vs Pharmaceuticals â€“ Neurotransmitter-Based Comparison

This table summarizes top psychiatric medications by neurotransmitter system, their associated FAERS/DAWN outcomes, and why amino acid therapy should be the **first-line approach** in many cases.

| **Neurotransmitter System** | **Condition(s)** | **Top Pharmaceuticals** | **Reported Deaths (2020â€“2024)** | **Why Natural First?** | **Amino Acid Support** |
|-----------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Serotonin** | Depression, Anxiety, Sleep Issues | Lexapro, Prozac, Zoloft | 9,450+ (suicide/overdose, FAERS) | Supports serotonin & melatonin naturally; fewer side effects, can be dosed flexibly. | L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP |
| **Dopamine (Catecholamines)** | Fatigue, Low Motivation, ADHD | Adderall, Ritalin, Wellbutrin | 5,120+ (stimulant toxicity, FAERS/DAWN) | Boosts energy, focus, and cognition without stimulant crashes or dependency. | L-Tyrosine, L-Phenylalanine |
| **GABA** | Stress, Panic, Insomnia | Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan | 7,300+ deaths, 12,800+ ER visits (FAERS/DAWN) | Provides calm without sedation, addiction, or withdrawal symptoms. | GABA, Theanine, Taurine |
| **Endorphins** | Emotional or Physical Pain, Grief | OxyContin, Vicodin, Morphine | 30,000+/year (CDC opioid crisis) | Enhances reward response without risk of overdose or respiratory depression. | D-Phenylalanine (DPA), DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) |


### ðŸ§  Note:
This chart does not position pharmaceuticals as the baseline or preferred option. Instead, it elevates **orthomolecular and naturopathic medicine** as the *first line of support*, offering lasting results and fewer risks.
