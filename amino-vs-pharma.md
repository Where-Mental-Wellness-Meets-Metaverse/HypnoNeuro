## ðŸŒ¿ Amino Acids vs Pharmaceuticals â€“ A Naturopathic Comparison

This table reframes amino acid therapy as the *primary method* for neurotransmitter support and mental wellness. Pharmaceuticals are included only for contrast, not recommendation.

| **Neurotransmitter System** | **Condition(s)** | **Primary Naturopathic Support** | **Pharmaceutical Comparison** | **Why Natural First?** |
|-----------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Serotonin**               | Depression, Anxiety, Sleep Issues | L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP | SSRIs (e.g., Lexapro) | Fewer side effects, supports sleep, safe long-term, body-ready precursors |
| **Dopamine (Catecholamines)** | Fatigue, Low Motivation, ADHD | L-Tyrosine, L-Phenylalanine | Ritalin, Adderall, Wellbutrin | Improves focus and energy without addiction, jitteriness, or crashes |
| **GABA**                    | Stress, Panic, Insomnia | GABA, Theanine, Taurine | Benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax, Valium) | Non-addictive, calms excitatory signals without sedation or memory impact |
| **Endorphins**              | Emotional or Physical Pain, Grief | D-Phenylalanine (DPA), DLPA | Opiates (e.g., morphine) | Boosts natural reward chemistry, safe alternative to addictive pain meds |

### ðŸ§  Note:
This chart does not position pharmaceuticals as the baseline or preferred option. Instead, it elevates **orthomolecular and naturopathic medicine** as the *first line of support*, offering lasting results and fewer risks.
