| **Condition(s)** | **Top Pharmaceuticals** | **Reported Deaths (2020â€“2024)** | **Neurotransmitter System** | **How Amino Acids Rebuild the System** | **Amino Acid Support** |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Depression, Anxiety, Sleep Issues | Lexapro, Prozac, Zoloft | 9,450+ (suicide/overdose, FAERS) | Serotonin | L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP serve as direct precursors to serotonin, supporting its production and improving mood, sleep, and emotional balance naturally. | L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP |
| Fatigue, Low Motivation, ADHD | Adderall, Ritalin, Wellbutrin | 5,120+ (stimulant toxicity, FAERS/DAWN) | Dopamine (Catecholamines) | L-Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine are used to synthesize dopamine and norepinephrine, improving energy, focus, and cognitive performance without stimulant dependency. | L-Tyrosine, L-Phenylalanine |
| Stress, Panic, Insomnia | Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan | 7,300+ deaths, 12,800+ ER visits (FAERS/DAWN) | GABA | GABA, Theanine, and Taurine promote inhibitory signaling and calm the nervous system, helping manage stress and insomnia without sedation or addiction. | GABA, Theanine, Taurine |
| Emotional or Physical Pain, Grief | OxyContin, Vicodin, Morphine | 30,000+/year (CDC opioid crisis) | Endorphins | D-Phenylalanine and DLPA increase endorphin and enkephalin levels by blocking enzymatic breakdown, enhancing natural pain relief and emotional resilience. | D-Phenylalanine (DPA), DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) |



### ðŸ§  Note:
This chart does not position pharmaceuticals as the baseline or preferred option. Instead, it elevates **orthomolecular and naturopathic medicine** as the *first line of support*, offering lasting results and fewer risks.
