# DSM-5 and the Absence of Biomarkers in Psychiatric Diagnosis

## Overview

The DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) remains the primary diagnostic tool for psychiatric classification. Despite its widespread use in clinical, academic, and insurance settings, it is important to acknowledge a critical limitation:

> **No DSM-5 psychiatric disorder has an FDA-approved biomarker that can be used to confirm diagnosis.**

## What Is a Biomarker?

A biomarker is a measurable biological indicator — such as a blood test, genetic marker, or brain scan — that can confirm the presence or absence of a condition. In physical medicine, biomarkers validate diagnoses (e.g., blood glucose for diabetes, MRI for stroke).

In psychiatry, however, diagnoses are based on:
- Clinical interviews
- Self-reported symptoms
- Observational checklists
- Interpretive judgment by the provider

## Examples of DSM Diagnoses Without Biomarkers

| Diagnosis                     | Biological Test? | Notes                                        |
|------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Major Depressive Disorder     | ❌               | No confirmatory lab or imaging tests        |
| Generalized Anxiety Disorder  | ❌               | Diagnosis based on subjective report        |
| Bipolar Disorder              | ❌               | No genetic or imaging confirmation          |
| ADHD                          | ❌               | Diagnosed behaviorally, especially in youth |
| PTSD                          | ❌               | Diagnosis requires subjective trauma history|
| OCD                           | ❌               | No biologic marker or brain scan protocol   |
| Schizophrenia                 | ❌               | Brain changes studied, but not diagnostic   |

Even schizophrenia — often thought to be “biological” — has no definitive test or marker that can confirm diagnosis independently of behavioral criteria.

## Implications for Positive Predictive Value (PPV)

**PPV** measures how likely it is that someone who receives a positive diagnosis *actually has* the condition.

> Without a biomarker or gold standard test, the PPV of DSM diagnoses becomes **unverifiable**.

This opens the door for:
- Misdiagnosis
- Overmedication
- Chronic labeling of transient emotion
