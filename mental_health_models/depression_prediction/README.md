# Depression Prediction Module

This module explores predictive modeling for depression using open-access mental health datasets. It supports HypnoNeuro's trauma-informed token logic and helps personalize user journeys.

## Goals
- Identify early signs of depressive episodes
- Integrate results with token rewards or avatar-based alerts
- Prepare foundation for future suicide risk modeling

## Status
‚úÖ Research & dataset identification  
üü° Initial EDA in progress  
‚¨úÔ∏è Modeling phase pending

## Ethics & Privacy
- All datasets are anonymized and publicly available
- No real-time user flagging in MVP
