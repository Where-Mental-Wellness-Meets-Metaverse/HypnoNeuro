# HypnoNeuro Stakeholder Summary

**A decentralized, data-backed solution for accessible mental health care**

## 🧠 The Problem

Millions still avoid mental health care due to:

- ❌ Stigma, shame, or fear of judgment  
- ❌ Lack of anonymity or culturally safe care  
- ❌ Inadequate workplace support or insurance  
- ❌ Distrust of pharmaceutical-based treatments

### 📉 The Data Speaks

- Over **50%** of people with symptoms have never sought treatment  
- Only **1 in 3 workplaces** offer mental health benefits  
- Suicide rates continue to rise — with major disparities by age, race, and gender
