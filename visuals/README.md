## Insight: Why This Chart Matters

Even in the tech industry — where access to healthcare is relatively high — nearly **half of respondents have not sought mental health treatment**.

This suggests that the real barriers may not be access, but rather **stigma**, **shame**, and a lack of safe spaces for disclosure.

It reinforces the need for **decentralized, anonymous systems** like HypnoNeuro that allow individuals to seek support without fear of judgment.

## Insight: Employer Support Isn’t Guaranteed

Only about one-third of respondents reported that their employer provides mental health benefits. Another third said “No,” and the rest weren’t even sure.

This shows a **systemic information gap**, lack of trust, or actual lack of access — all of which highlight the need for **private, user-controlled mental health systems** like HypnoNeuro, where support isn't dependent on your job.
