## 🧩 Section 1: Gaps in Workplace Mental Health Support

### 📊 Awareness of Employer Mental Health Care Options
Even in industries with high healthcare access, nearly one-third of respondents said they **don’t know** what their employer offers for mental health support.  
➡️ This reflects a deeper disconnect between employees and the systems that claim to support them.

### 📊 Employer Mental Health Benefits Access
Only about one-third of respondents reported their employer provides mental health benefits.  
➡️ This highlights a systemic **information gap or actual lack of access** — reinforcing the need for user-controlled mental health platforms like HypnoNeuro.

### 📊 Comfort Discussing Mental Health with Coworkers
Many respondents said **“No”** or **“Some of them”** when asked about comfort with coworkers.  
➡️ Stigma exists laterally — even among peers — validating the need for anonymous healing spaces.

### 📊 Comfort Discussing Mental Health with Supervisor
Fear of supervisor judgment limits openness.  
➡️ A clear lack of psychological safety in the workplace supports our design for **non-employer-linked support**.

## 🧩 Section 2: Structural & Psychological Barriers to Care

### 📊 Perceived Protection by Anonymity
Many respondents reported they **did not feel protected** by workplace anonymity claims.  
➡️ This shows a lack of trust in institutional confidentiality and supports HypnoNeuro’s **Web3-based anonymous model**.

### 📊 Perceived Ease of Taking Mental Health Leave
Most respondents said it would be **somewhat** or **very difficult** to take time off for mental health.  
➡️ Policies do not equal psychological safety — which is why HypnoNeuro provides access without time-off disclosures.

### 📊 Family History vs. Treatment Seeking Behavior
Even those with a family history of mental illness had **not sought treatment themselves**.  
➡️ This reveals that awareness alone isn’t enough — we must meet users where they are with stigma-free, low-barrier access.

### 📊 Treatment Memory Discrepancy (50% Gap)
Roughly **half of respondents** who may have received care **don’t recall or acknowledge it**.  
➡️ This supports the need for **trauma-informed design** and **gamified re-engagement** strategies.

## 🧩 Section 3: Suicide Rates (Urgency & Justification)

### 📊 Suicide Rates by Age (2024)
Youth and older adults are among the most at-risk populations.  
➡️ HypnoNeuro’s layered therapy rooms target age-specific triggers and healing styles.

### 📊 Suicide Rates by Sex (2024)
Males die by suicide nearly **4x** more than females.  
➡️ This disparity requires **gender-sensitive** and anonymous solutions to reduce stigma in help-seeking behavior.

### 📊 Suicide Rates by Race & Ethnicity (2024)
American Indian/Alaska Native populations face the **highest suicide rates**.  
➡️ Highlights the need for **culturally competent, accessible care** unconstrained by mainstream systems.
