# HypnoNeuro: Decentralized Mental Wellness for All

**HypnoNeuro** is a gamified, Web3-powered mental health platform designed to provide **anonymous, stigma-free access** to trauma-informed care — especially for underserved and high-risk populations.

---

## 🧠 Why HypnoNeuro?

Despite growing awareness, millions still avoid mental health care due to:

- **Stigma and shame** around seeking therapy
- **Privacy concerns** and fear of judgment in traditional healthcare settings
- **Mistrust of doctors** and conventional medication-based treatments
- **Lack of access to care**, especially for underserved or high-risk populations

**HypnoNeuro** provides a solution by leveraging **blockchain privacy**, **NFT-based incentives**, and **decentralized tools** to make healing accessible **on your terms**.
