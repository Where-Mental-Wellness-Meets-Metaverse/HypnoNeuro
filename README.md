🧠 Why HypnoNeuro?
Despite growing awareness, millions still avoid mental health care due to:

Stigma and shame around seeking therapy

Privacy concerns and fear of judgment in traditional healthcare settings

Mistrust of doctors and conventional medication-based treatments

Lack of access to care, especially for underserved or high-risk populations

HypnoNeuro provides a solution by leveraging blockchain privacy, NFT-based incentives, and decentralized tools to make healing accessible on your terms.

🔍 Data-Backed Insights
We analyzed national and workplace survey data to validate the need for decentralized care:

Treatment Summary – 50%+ have never received mental health treatment

Employer Support – Only 1 in 3 jobs offer mental health coverage

Disclosure Concerns – Many fear speaking to coworkers or supervisors

Anonymity & Leave – People don’t feel safe or supported using benefits

Suicide Rates (CDC) – Stark disparities by sex, age, and race
