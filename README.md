# HypnoNeuro: Decentralized Mental Wellness for All

**HypnoNeuro** is a gamified, Web3-powered mental health platform designed to provide **anonymous, stigma-free access** to trauma-informed care — especially for underserved and high-risk populations.

---

## 🧠 Why HypnoNeuro?

Despite growing awareness, millions still avoid mental health care due to:

- Stigma and shame
- Fear of disclosure at work
- High costs or lack of insurance
- Mistrust of traditional medication-based treatment
- Lack of anonymity or culturally safe options

Our platform leverages **blockchain privacy**, **NFT-based incentives**, and **decentralized tools** to make healing accessible on your terms.

## 🔍 Data-Backed Insights

We analyzed national and workplace survey data to validate the need for decentralized care:

- [Employer Support](visuals/README.md) – Only 1 in 3 jobs offer mental health coverage
- [Disclosure Concerns](visuals/README.md) – Many fear speaking to coworkers or supervisors
- [Anonymity & Leave](visuals/README.md) – People don’t feel safe or supported using benefits
- [Suicide Rates (CDC)](visuals/README.md) – Stark disparities by sex, age, and race
